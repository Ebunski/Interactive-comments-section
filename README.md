## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Ebunski : -

- Converting from static to dynamic mark-up and react set-up exercise
- Setting a state to manage id
- CRUD operation -
  Had problems with adding and deleting from nested arrays.
- Reusing components (e.g markdown and comment components) , recursive rendering, default props etc.
- Dynamic and conditional rendering e.g action buttons, replies, markdown, photo etc.
- Time tracker code.

Catalyst : -

- Got to brush up on my usage of Git and GitHub. Finally, understood what I was doing a bit.
- Had to revise my knowledge of grid layout(specifically grid-area)

````css
.proud-of-this {
  grid-template-columns: 4rem auto auto repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-areas:
      'li id id tm re re'
      'li ct ct ct ct ct'
      'sm ct ct ct ct ct';
}
````
- Got to sneak peak into React and how it works, gained a lot there.

Overall :-
-Teamwork: 1st time i actually collaborated with someone on a project
- Git and Github - understood the architecture, workflow and other git commands


### Continued development

- React
- SCSS
